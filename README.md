## What is Data Science?

## Intro to Python

Initial intro to python forked and remixed from "A Beginner's Python Tutorial" by Steven Thurlow.

So Few Workers Go Home On Time

## Pandas 

Core content sourced from https://github.com/jorisvandenbossche/pandas-tutorial pending approval.

* .apply()
* Broadcacsting e.g. df['a'] + df['b']
* 
* Drop nulls (+ what is a null)
* Accessing elements (.iloc[] and .loc[])
* Simple rules for faster calculations

## SKLearn

Based on excellent course by Jake Van Der Plas https://github.com/jakevdp/sklearn_tutorial

* Feature selection
* Feature transformation
* Simple exercise of setting a literal threshold as a classifier
* The BMI example for feature transformation

* Logistic regression
* Linear regression
* K Nearest Neighbours (do some slightly flair demo here)
* Decision Trees
* Random Forests
* Boosting Algorithms

* Dataset splitting (train, validation, evaluation)
* Hyperparameter optimization (optuna)


## Numpy

## Flask (maybe skip to FastAPI)

* What is an endpoint?
* Deploying a very simple model
